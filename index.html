            <div class="bio">
            <p>Jane is originally from Yorkshire in the United Kingdom, but now resides in Vancouver, BC.</p>
            <p>She has extensive experience working in the arts sector, having worked in and operated box offices and managed ticketing systems across numerous venues and large-scale events since 2008. Wrangling ticketing systems led to an interest in databases and data analytics, while the nature of working in under-resourced charitable organizations meant she also had the opportunity to develop skills in  digital marketing and web development.</p>
            <p>Now studying towards a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science at Dominican University of California, Jane is a Dev Degree intern at Shopify, looking to expand her understanding of systems and her love of creative problem solving.</p>

                A fun and fascinating look at great scientific paradoxes.
            
Throughout history, scientists have come up with theories and ideas that just don't seem to make sense. These we call paradoxes. The paradoxes Al-Khalili offers are drawn chiefly from physics and astronomy and represent those that have stumped some of the finest minds. For example, how can a cat be both dead and alive at the same time?  Why will Achilles never beat a tortoise in a race, no matter how fast he runs? And how can a person be ten years older than his twin?<br>

            <blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/07/doctor-who-redacted-bbc-podcast-review-access-all-will-be-wild">The podcast uses the 6 January 2021 invasion of the US Capitol building as its kick-off, analysing not simply why such an utterly shocking event happened, but how it was allowed to. The information it uncovers is indeed wild. An interviewee informs us that he and others warned the Department of Homeland Security that such an event was likely to occur… and nothing happened. When another DHS worker wrote a report describing the threat of domestic terrorism from rightwing extremists, he was forced from his job. Will Be Wild leads you to understand that 6 January wasn’t an end, but a staging post. Grimly gripping.<br>

                The Beef’s kitchen is a constant cacophony of shouting, several of the characters are ticking time bombs of grief, and Carmy is an exacting boss over several perfectionists. But its eight half-hour episodes, all released last week, manage to capture the visceral, heart-palpitating adrenaline of the professional kitchen, the financial precarity of the restaurant business, and the drive to subject oneself to it better than any scripted show in recent memory.
